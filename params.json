  "body": "### Implementation\r\nThis is the implementation of the [“Face Detection, Pose Estimation, and Landmark Localization in the Wild”](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/face/) algorithm by Xiangxin Zhu and Deva Ramanan. This implementation was firstly designed for being used by embedded systems but finally it can also be used by large multiprocessors systems. Our implementation is in basic C\\C++ and there is no usage of any external library in the core of the algorithm. This gives the algorithm the ability to be used in both Windows and UNIX systems with no further changes. It also allows further improvements and alteration as it is easily readable for those who would like to use it for custom application.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThis implementation was created as a master thesis in the Technical University of Crete by Panos Kalodimas and its documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/null0llun/TSM-Face-Detector/tree/master/documentation). The implementation offers two extra patches as referred in the documentation chapter 6 (Default Patches). The rest patches presented in chapter 8 (Alternative Patches) are not included. In the documentation the memory consumption and the execution time performance can also be found for embedded system usage.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAccording to the documentations there are multiple implementation versions offered. The default and recommended version offered in the master branch is the v3.2.2. All the available versions can be downloaded separately in the following links:\r\n- [version 1.3.0](https://github.com/null0llun/TSM-Face-Detector/archive/version-1.3.zip)\r\n- [version 2.1.2](https://github.com/null0llun/TSM-Face-Detector/archive/version-2.1.zip)\r\n- [version 2.2.2](https://github.com/null0llun/TSM-Face-Detector/archive/version-2.2.zip)\r\n- [version 3.1.2](https://github.com/null0llun/TSM-Face-Detector/archive/version-3.1.zip)\r\n- [version 3.2.2](https://github.com/null0llun/TSM-Face-Detector/archive/version-3.2.zip)\r\n- [version 4.1.2](https://github.com/null0llun/TSM-Face-Detector/archive/version-4.1.zip)",
